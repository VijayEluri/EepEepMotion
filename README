There are hard coded paths in EepEepMotion.pde. You will need to change these; 
particularly project_root_path.

You will need to install peasycam (http://mrfeinberg.com/peasycam/).

To export blender animations to a form readable by EepEepMotion, you need to use
the included blender plugin blender/export_ascii.py. You should link this
into blender's scripts directory.
