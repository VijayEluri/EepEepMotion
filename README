There are hard coded paths in EepEepMotion.pde. You will need to change these; 
particularly project_root_path.

You will need to install peasycam (http://mrfeinberg.com/peasycam/).

To export blender animations to a form readable by EepEepMotion, you need to use
the included blender plugin blender/export_ascii.py. You should link this
into blender's scripts directory.

The subdirectory Travels/ includes most of the sources necessary to reconstruct
the Travels of Code Monkey video. Notably missing are the source photographs,
which I could not include here for sake of space and IP issues. I've asked
the photographers about making the photos available under creative commons,
but have not been able to get a response from all of them. 

There is a skeleton directory tree under Travels/pictures. In each
subdirectory, there is a file called 'View Online.url' with the url for
that album. The easiest way to download these albums is probably using
the Picasa application, though it can also be done using a combination
of GreaseMonkey and DownThemAll.
