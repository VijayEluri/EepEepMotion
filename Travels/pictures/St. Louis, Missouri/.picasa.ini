caption=Here I am, entering St. Louis.  There's the token picture of me with the Gateway Arch. Pretty impressive structure, really.   It's over 600 feet tall, and is the nation's tallest memorial structure.It's also just as wide as it is tall, which is hard to comprehend in this shot.

caption=Opposite the Arch is the Riverfront.  Whether this particular riverfront is of the Mississippi or Missouri River, I'm not sure. (Pretty sure it's Mississippi, but what do I know?).  As you can see, the river's function as an avenue of commerce has now dissipated, making its value limited to its use as a way to slide Casinos in under the 'No Gambling Establishments on Missouri Land' rule.  "But sir..it's not ON land. It's on the water!"  Get it?  Sneaky Missourians and Illinoisians.

caption=What does 'NOO' stand for?My host in St. Louis is Jennifer, a 30-something wife and mother of four.  Nice family, though Jen is a Mac Enthusiast and a conservative.  She does web design out of her home, so we could talk login pages.  She suggested we come here, as she felt that this 'NOO' was the sort of company I might enjoy visiting.Still don't know what it stands for though.  Nationwide Object Orientation?  Native Overhead Optimization?

caption=Okay.. this begins the Alcoholic branch of our tour of StL.  As many know, St. Louis is a big brewery town, best known as the homeplace of Anheuser Busch (which we'll get to in a minute).  What is NOT as popularly known is that several other brewers got their start here too, notably the Lemp Family.  They went belly-up during Prohibition (as they were not as good at switching to alternative products as AB was), but in their heyday they gave Busch a run for his money.The Lemp recipe has gone on to become Falstaff, I think, which may also explain why it represented an epic fail in the long run.  What makes the Lemps interesting now is that this mansion, the Lemp Mansion (which is two stories taller than you can see in this shot), is where they lived and also where a number of them died.  At least three members of the family committed suicide in this house for one reason or another, and a number of others died here by natural causes.  Now it's reputed to be one of the most haunted places in the US.

caption=Big Horse, Too Valuable to Touch.  The AB trademark of a horse-drawn beer wagon pulled by Clydesdale horses has led AB to become one of the foremost Clydesdale breeders in the world.  Apparently each of these guys weighs between 1600 and 2300 pounds, eats 20-25 quarts of ats and 50-60 pounds of hay each day.  They bring in about $80K each.

caption=Our last stop before leaving Missouri was Historic Main Street in St. Charles.  Apparently the French set up a settlement here just before the Louisiana Purchase, and Lewis and Clark used St.Charles as a sort of jumping-off point for their Western Territories tour.  This bit of historic significance has led St. Charles residents to preserve the old main street of Le Petite Cotes (the Little Hills, the original name of St. Charles) and dedicate some of their local land to celebrating Lewis and Clark.  This bronze statue of Merriweather Lewis and William Clark was commissioned in honor of the bicentennial of their Corps of Discovery.  That dog is Lewis' Newfoundland, "Seaman", who accompanied them the whole way.  How they called the dog without inciting snickers, I have no idea.

caption=Here's an actual shot of Historic main.  Note that the street is paved with cobbles, and all of the store fronts are mostly original. Whenever historians here aren't blathering on about Lewis and Clark, they've usually downshifted into Daniel Boone, who also lived around here at some point.  About half the town is named Boone-something.  My favorite is the 'Boone's Lick Inn'.  History is great and all, but there's such a thing as too much information.
